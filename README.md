## Heart Disease Prediction Model

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction Model that leverages K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.

## 📌 Features

Implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest classifiers

Utilizes Scikit-learn for machine learning models

Evaluates model performance using classification reports and accuracy scores

Provides an interactive and user-friendly way to predict heart disease risk

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

Pandas (Data Handling)

NumPy (Numerical Computing)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

## 📂 Dataset

The model is trained on a heart disease dataset containing various health metrics such as:

Age

Gender

Blood Pressure

Cholesterol Levels

Heart Rate

Other medical indicators

## 📊 Model Performance

We trained and evaluated both models:

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Accuracy: ~78%

Pros: Simple and effective for small datasets

Cons: Slower for large datasets

## Random Forest

Accuracy: ~97%

Pros: Handles large datasets well, reduces overfitting

Cons: Slightly more computationally expensive
## 📝 How It Works

Load the dataset

Preprocess the data (handle missing values, scaling, encoding, etc.)

Train the models (KNN & Random Forest)

Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Make predictions based on user input

## 📌 Results & Visualization

The model's performance is visualized using confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy graphs.

Feature importance analysis is conducted to understand key predictors of heart disease.
